This is my personal project that I developed while following some tutorials for MERN.
Its a mini app to collect happy moments as a post.
I did it in order to get full understanding of MERN stack.

-After completing this I have, 
- understanding of structuring a MERN App.
- Used Redux for state funtionality 
- Authentication done through JWT and Google OAuth.
- understanding of REACT along with utlisizing material UI for styling.
- set up MongoDB through Atlas
- deployed backend server side through Heroku and frontend client side on netlify
